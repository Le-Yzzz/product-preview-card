## My process

I started working on the desktop version first. Before working on the code, i analize the image and see what kind of elements i'll need. Then i start to code the site from from top to bottom. After coding the desktop version, i finally move on to the mobile and make the adjustments necesary, like changing the flex-direction to column.

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- SAAS

### What I learned

One thing you never get tired of learning is that even the smallest details count. When writing code, be sure to know WHY you're adding that line of code. Otherwise you end up with unnecessary elements or lines of css. Knowing why you're doing things will help later in the future when looking for an error.

### Continued development

I'd like to keep learning box-sizing. I still struggle to figure out how much padding/margin to add to an element.
